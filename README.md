# Stream Chat Relay

## This project has been deprecated since it's way to complicated to generate YouTube OAuth credentials.

This tool was supposed to be a self-hosted bot, but since it takes way too much efford to get YouTube API working (creating a new project on Google Console, registering a callback URL, validating domain ownership using DNS, etc).

If you know how to get this working, you should be able to reverse-engineer this code.
